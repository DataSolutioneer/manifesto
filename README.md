Data Solutioning is a high level concept that encompasses data infrastructure, data architecture, data integration, data analysis, data science and data software engineering.  

A Data Solutioneer is a practitioner of these concepts involving the art and science of solving problems with Data.

We are a group of individuals who are experts in one or more of these disciplines.  We live and breathe data, desire standardization, pursue consistent definition, focus on flexible architectures and develop solutions to solve real-world problems.  We perceive the **misuse of data as a lack of knowledge regarding the overall intrinsic value and as such creating technical debt and business loss**.

## Why the Manifesto

We all create data, every hour of every day.  As individuals it may not be that much of a problem.  But for business's it can make or break their competitive edge.  Businesses create massive amounts of data and every time they do, the business is taking a **risk**.  The risk, is that after some time has passed, the business ends up with a pool of data that does not provide any kind of value outside of the source system it was created in.  What makes matters worse, is that the architecture of the source system may have never defined the data or structured it in an "easy to move" way.

This risk is amplified without the presence of a strong bond between technical decision making and business goals. We think that every technical decision  involving the creation of data, should be made considering every aspect of the context in which the data oriented solution "lives" and consider the future downstream usage of said data.

## Our purpose
We commit to learn and help others learn how to deliver solutions with a data-first approach. This means to **consider the "data life-cycle" as an overarching theme when choosing technologies** for a new project or a new feature of an existing project. We aim to help others think about data applications downstream - anticipating the unintended opportunities that exist because of this new data.  Our interest in pursuing these purposes is to instill the concept that value exists when data is made available and analyzed by domain experts and delivered as solutions in an operational way.

## Principles

These are a draft of the principles that guide us:

* Data is an Asset
* Data is Shared and Accessible
* Data is Managed and Stewarded
* Data is Defined and Standardized
* Data is Secured

## Our Manifesto

We are going to define and publish the Manifesto of the Data Solutioneer. **We want to create it sharing our ideas with other solutioneers, so right now we're creating a distributed team to help us to create a good Manifesto**. If you want to be part of this team please send an email to jeff@datasolutioneer.com.

## Be Involved

**We accept any kind of feedback**, so if you want to discuss with us about any of the topics stated here just open an Issue or a Pull Request.

Since we don't have a manifesto yet, there's no way to actually sign it for now. **To show appreciation for this idea you can star the repo**, it will help us to understand how many people are interested in this topic.
